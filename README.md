----

The ContentMine ecosystem as a standalone app for OSX, Windows and Linux.

NOT YET READY FOR DEPLOYMENT.

The ContentMine app lets you perform all the steps in the ContentMine workflow:

- get lists of newly published articles published in journals, either by using the JournalTOCs feed, or by crawling the journal website.
- scrape metadata and documents for the articles you select, storing the results locally and submitting them to the ContentMine datastore.
- extract facts from the documents you've scraped by using the remote ContentMine fact extraction service, getting back a dataset.

This app is being scaffolded in preparation for the Mozilla Sprint.
